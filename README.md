VIC :D
Vic i will curl up on your head like in YTTD RP and NEVERRR move. You're so fun to hang out with and always understand me, and it makes me sad that i cant always go out with you just to get your iced latte. LIKEE what if we sat at a cafe and yapped about everything that ever happened while enjoying some nice drinks together.. JUST IMAGINE. maybe itll be possible one day to do so!! we are sooo driving with our darlings!!

megumi doesnt get SHIT mmm puppy this policewomans BUSSIN'

Vivy !!
NEVER have i felt so safe coping'linking as luka around someone (even if theyre OK with it),, you always seem to know what to do, even if you're busy you let me cuddle and feel safe in the state that c'linking luka happens because of. i hope that was clear.. i also love your ponies so much!! i hope i was as nice to be around as you are to be^_^ even if i dont get to visit as often!!

HEX :3 
HEX YOUUU YOU YOU YOU!! You silly poor thang.. i love the randomness of our interactions, like one day we're talking about komahina baby and the other we're just cuddling around. i feel really guilty that i keep confusing cassidy with futaba BUT SHE LOOKS SO CUTE!! You like so many peak... and youre literally THE splatoon fan to me. it kind of comforting since i used to be around fans, and i put my soul into a marina fursona for someone once.. i also just fele pregnant around you idk why

LANIE <3 
You're soo so chill but passionate and are literally just a Chill Guy like. youre the takumi kind of person where you seem normal but actually Oh my god youre so insane i love you. i will always enjoy listening to you talk about homestuck, even if i may not have much to say!! dont let my silence stop you from thinking i enjoy listening to you!! i also love teasing you now and then :3

LUNA !!!
Luna dreemurr... it seems we reunite at least.. /j i love your energy so much . if your energy was a character design when i think itd look like darumi amemiya.. I DONT KNOW WHY i think its the pretty colors and uniqueness of her creativity and expression. and i dont know why but its you in a way!! praying oyu dont relate to her too hard though.. scary OK? youre like a sibling to me and i will spin you and vin around like a blood separator!!
